Immersive UI Bugs

Homescreen:

- Carousel image goes underneath the top bar (maybe remove the top bar completely and add the "settings to the search fab)
- Recently Added to Stuff carousel the cards are too large and use horizontal cards not vertical


Your Library Screen:

- Looks good just center the text horizontally

Movies Library Screen: 

- Carousel image goes below or underneath the top bar (same concept maybe remove top bar completely)
- Scrolling to the bottom of the screen crashes the app (might be fixed but check Crashlytics report via Firebase)
- Button vertically above the search FAB doesn't do anything

Movie Detail Screen:

- Text under the movie logo is bunched together and not spaced out (Rating Card, "R", Year & Runtime)
- Center the detail text about the movie under the rating info horizontally (3 lines total)
- Change the "FHD" text and colored cards behind it with offical Material 3 Expressive icons that exist
- When scrolling down the screen the carousel image scrolls down the screen also and goes underneath the UI elements then   disapears

TV Show Library Screen:

- Carousel image goes below or underneath the top bar (same concept maybe remove top bar completely)
- Scrolling to the bottom of the screen crashes the app (might be fixed but check Crashlytics report via Firebase)
- Button vertically above the search FAB doesn't do anything

TV Show Detail Screen:

- When scrolling down the screen the carousel image scrolls down the screen also and goes underneath the UI elements then   disapears
- Under the TV Show icon right now shows Rating and Year, for Year if it is on multiple yeras list that (i.e. 2020-2024) and if still on today we can say i.e. 2020-Present or something like that
- Rating and "Ongoing" text is over the description text we can make those larger in size and horizontally centered
- Description of TV Show horizontally centered and 3 lines works
- Underneath the description text is the tags about the show i.e. Adventure create buttons and don't allow them to go off the screen - limit them to the horizontal screen width so no scrolling
- Dropdown for Seasons shows the season # which is good but says 0 episodes even though there are more than 0
- Check what happens when people click on the "More Like This" icon for said TV Show seems like it is doing something odd and needs to be improved like the Movies "More Like this"

Stuff (homevideo) Library Screen & stuff detail screen still shows old library screens
