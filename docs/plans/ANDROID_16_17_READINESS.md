# Cinefin — Android 16 & 17 Readiness Checklist

**Generated**: 2026-05-26
**Current state**: `compileSdk = 37`, `targetSdk = 37`, `minSdk = 30`, NDK `29.0.14206865`, AGP `9.2.1`, Kotlin `2.3.21`
**Scope**: Behavior changes, deprecations, and new platform features that apply once Cinefin runs (or targets) Android 16 (API 36, "Baklava") and Android 17 (API 37).

This document is the **single source of truth** for Android 16/17 requirements and tracking.

This document supersedes the open items in:
- `docs/plans/2026-03-28-android-16-17-modernization.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-04-26-android-16-17-modernization-phase-2.md`

Items already complete in the codebase are listed at the bottom in **§9 — Already Done** so we don't redo them.

## Quick tracking order (use this first)

If you only need one short list to work from, follow these in order:

1. Finish all unchecked items in **§1 Hard Compatibility Items**.
2. Then complete **§2 Behavior Changes** that impact all devices.
3. Then complete selected feature adoption work from **§3–§4**.
4. Use **§8 Risk Ranking** to prioritize and **§9 Already Done** to avoid duplicate work.

---

## 1. Hard Compatibility Items (must-pass before shipping to SDK 37)

These will silently break the app or get flagged by the Play Console review for new Android 17 uploads. None are theoretical — each one maps to a specific behavior change or to a Play policy gate.

### 1.1 — 16 KB page size for native libraries
Android 15+ devices ship with 16 KB memory pages and Play requires that new apps and updates be 16 KB compatible from **November 1, 2025**. We have one native dependency we don't build ourselves:

- `org.jellyfin.media3:media3-ffmpeg-decoder:1.9.0+1` — bundles `libffmpegJNI.so`
- `androidx.graphics:graphics-path` — bundles `libandroidx.graphics.path.so`
- DataStore — bundles `libdatastore_shared_counter.so`

**Action**:
- [ ] Add a CI check that runs `zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4 app-release.apk` (or `apksigner verify --print-page-size`) and fails if any `.so` is not 16 KB aligned.
- [ ] Verify `libffmpegJNI.so` version 1.9.0+1 is 16 KB aligned. If not, bump to whichever release of `jellyfin-media3-ffmpeg-decoder` is built with NDK r28+. (Our own NDK `29.0.14206865` is fine.)
- [ ] Test a release APK on an Android 16 emulator with a 16 KB system image (`system-images;android-36;google_apis;arm64-v8a` — the `_16k_` variant).

### 1.2 — Edge-to-edge enforcement (Android 16, targetSdk 36+)
On SDK 36+, apps can no longer opt out of edge-to-edge. `Window.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` is now a no-op-or-crash; the system *always* draws under system bars. We already call `enableEdgeToEdge()` in `MainActivity` and use `WindowInsets.statusBars` / `WindowInsets.navigationBars` in Compose. Remaining audit items:

- [ ] **`VideoPlayerActivity`** — `Theme.JellyfinAndroid.VideoPlayer` correctly drops the deprecated `windowFullscreen` flags (good), but verify the runtime full-screen path in `setupFullScreenMode()` uses `WindowInsetsControllerCompat.hide(systemBars())` with `BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE`, not the deprecated `systemUiVisibility` flags.
- [ ] **Bottom sheets, dialogs, snackbars** — anywhere we wrap a `Scaffold` with a custom bottom bar (`JellyfinApp.kt` lines ~334, ~369, ~407 use `WindowInsets.navigationBars.asPaddingValues().calculateBottomPadding()` manually), confirm they don't double-pad once the system enforces edge-to-edge. Prefer `Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()` or `Scaffold`'s built-in `contentWindowInsets` over manual `WindowInsets.navigationBars` reads.
- [ ] **TV surface (`TvJellyfinApp`)** — TV runs without system bars but the same code path executes. Sanity check that the manual `navigationBars` padding becomes zero on Leanback rather than introducing a phantom gap.
- [ ] **Status bar / nav bar color** — these XML attrs are deprecated at SDK 35+; we don't set them in `themes.xml`, but double-check no inherited style does.

### 1.3 — Adaptive / large screen mandate (Android 16)
Apps on screens **≥600dp** can no longer opt out of resizability or lock orientation, regardless of `android:resizeableActivity` and `android:screenOrientation`. We're well-positioned (`resizeableActivity="true"`, `MainActivity` uses `screenOrientation="user"`), but the player needs work:

- [ ] **`VideoPlayerActivity`** sets `requestedOrientation = ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_SENSOR` at runtime (line 329). On ≥600dp devices on Android 16, the system will *ignore* this. Confirm the player still renders correctly when the system forces a re-layout mid-playback (configChanges handles orientation, but verify `screenLayout`, `density`, and `smallestScreenSize` are also handled — they are, per the manifest).
- [ ] Add a Robolectric or instrumentation test that resizes the activity at ≥600dp width and asserts the ExoPlayer surface survives without releasing the player.
- [ ] Audit `configChanges` on `VideoPlayerActivity`. Missing from the list: `uiMode` (dark/light switch), `fontScale`, `layoutDirection`. Decide per-attribute whether to handle or to recreate.

### 1.4 — Foreground service type strictness (Android 14+, tightened in 15/16)
We use two FGS types: `mediaPlayback` (`AudioService`) and `dataSync` (download worker). Already mostly correct, but:

- [ ] Confirm `AudioService.onCreate()` calls `startForeground(...)` **within 5 seconds** of the service starting in every code path, including the rebind/restart after `onTaskRemoved`. The Media3 `MediaSessionService` base class handles this, but our custom `notificationProvider` swap could regress it — add a unit test that asserts `startForeground` is called before any awaitable suspension.
- [ ] Long-running downloads on Android 15+ hit the **6-hour cumulative dataSync FGS quota**. `OfflineDownloadWorker` needs a fallback: when a single download exceeds 6h (e.g. transcoding a 4K Blu-ray remux on a slow server), switch to `setExpedited` chunks or chain `OneTimeWorkRequest`s. Today the worker can be killed silently mid-download. *Tracked in IMPROVEMENT_PLAN §2.1; promote to Android-16-blocker.*
- [ ] Declare `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROCESSING` (new in API 36) for any future server-side transcode-monitoring service. Not used today; leave as a note.

### 1.5 — `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` runtime grant on SDK 37
Already implemented in `ServerConnectionScreen.kt` (lines 121–148), but the gating is fragile:

- [ ] The launcher fires from `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` on every recomposition of the screen. Once the user denies it once, it won't auto-relaunch — good — but the UI doesn't tell them why discovery is broken. Add an inline rationale + a "Grant in Settings" deep-link.
- [ ] Permission denial should not block manual server URL entry. Confirm `onRestartDiscovery` is only called when granted, and the manual URL flow still works without it.
- [ ] Add a robolectric test for `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 37` permission denial → manual entry still functional.

### 1.6 — Certificate Transparency enforcement
`network_security_config.xml` notes "Certificate Transparency (enforced at API 37+) applies automatically to all HTTPS connections." This is correct, but:

- [ ] User-installed CAs (TOFU pinning flow) **bypass CT** in the system trust store. Our config currently trusts both `<certificates src="system"/>` and `<certificates src="user"/>` in the base-config. Verify on a real Android 17 build that the certificate-pinning TOFU flow still works against a self-signed Jellyfin server. CT only enforces against publicly-trusted CAs, so user-CA pinning should still work — but **test it**.
- [ ] If we ever add a "known servers" list as hinted in the NSC comment, give each one its own `<domain-config>` with `cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"`.

### 1.7 — `usesCleartextTraffic` deprecation (SDK 37)
We're already doing this right — cleartext is controlled via NSC, not the manifest attribute. The NSC comment ("`usesCleartextTraffic` is deprecated at API 37") is correct. **No action required**, just don't add the attribute later.

---

## 2. Behavior Changes That Apply to All Apps (regardless of targetSdk)

These changes hit when the *device* is Android 16/17, even if `targetSdk` is lower. We've already opted in to SDK 37, so they apply unconditionally.

### 2.1 — JobScheduler quota tightening (Android 15+)
Regular jobs get a stricter execution-runtime quota. WorkManager handles this transparently, but expedited jobs (`setExpedited(OutOfQuotaPolicy.RUN_AS_NON_EXPEDITED_WORK_REQUEST)`) silently demote. Audit:

- [ ] `OfflineDownloadWorker` — uses ForegroundInfo (FGS), so quota doesn't apply directly, but any chained workers may. Grep for `setExpedited` and document expected behavior.

### 2.2 — Notification permission UX (Android 13+, stricter prompt suppression on 16)
Android 16 will suppress repeated rejected prompts more aggressively. We currently request from `DownloadButton` and `ImmersiveTVEpisodeDetailScreen`:

- [ ] Add `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` check before launching. Show our own pre-prompt explaining why downloads need a notification.
- [ ] After two denials, treat notifications as permanently denied for this session and surface a "Notifications disabled — open Settings" affordance next to the download button instead of re-prompting.

### 2.3 — `getParcelableExtra(name, Class)` migration
Already done in `AudioService.kt`. One more spot — `MainActivity.handleHandoffIntent` reads several string and long extras, which are fine. **No further action.**

---

## 3. Android 16 Feature Adoption (opportunity, not blocker)

### 3.1 — `Notification.ProgressStyle` (Android 16, NotificationCompat 1.13+)
**Partially done.** `OfflineDownloadWorker` already wraps `NotificationCompat.ProgressStyle` behind `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 36`. Polish remaining:

- [ ] Add segment styling — break the progress bar into "downloading" (blue) and "transcoding" (orange) segments using `ProgressStyle.Segment` for clearer UX when transcoding precedes download.
- [ ] Add `setStyledByProgress(false)` if we want the icon to stay our brand color rather than the progress tint.
- [ ] Set `Notification.CATEGORY_PROGRESS` (already done) and consider the new `Notification.LIVE_UPDATE` category once it's promoted out of beta on API 36+ for the persistent ongoing-download notification.

### 3.2 — Richer haptics (`VibrationEffect.Composition` primitives)
**Done.** `ExpressiveHaptics.kt` already uses `PRIMITIVE_QUICK_RISE`, `PRIMITIVE_QUICK_FALL`, `PRIMITIVE_THUD` with `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 36` guards. Polish only:

- [ ] Replace the hardcoded `>= 36` numeric literal with `>= Build.VERSION_CODES.BAKLAVA` once the constant lands in our compileSdk. (It does at SDK 36 — use `Build.VERSION_CODES.BAKLAVA`.)
- [ ] Add a per-device capability check via `vibrator.areAllPrimitivesSupported(PRIMITIVE_QUICK_RISE, ...)`. Some OEMs report API 36 but ship a basic vibrator that no-ops the composition. Fall back to legacy haptics when unsupported.
- [ ] Wire `seekTick()` into the seek bar in `ExpressiveVideoControls.kt` (the plan in `2026-04-26-...-phase-2.md` Step 2.3 hasn't been done yet).

### 3.3 — Embedded Photo Picker (Android 16)
**Not done.** Plan called for profile-image picker integration. Currently we don't have a profile-image upload flow at all. Defer — when we add it, use `ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia()` with embedded preview on API 36+.

### 3.4 — Frame-rate hints API
Android 15+ exposes `Surface.setFrameRate()` to declare the desired frame rate to the display compositor. The ExoPlayer/Media3 1.10+ codepath does this for us when video frame rate metadata is available. **Verify** by checking `VideoPlayerScreen` doesn't override the surface frame rate, then no action.

### 3.5 — Predictive Back Compose integration
We have `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` ✓ but **zero `BackHandler` or `PredictiveBackHandler` usages** anywhere in `app/src/main`. That means:

- [ ] Custom back handling in nested screens (drawers, detail screens, video controls overlay) currently relies entirely on the OS-level dispatcher. That's fine in most places, but the player's full-screen controls overlay should be dismissible via predictive back — wire up `PredictiveBackHandler` to consume the back swipe and fade the controls instead of exiting the player on the first swipe.
- [ ] Navigation Compose 2.10+ has its own predictive-back animation support; verify `JellyfinNavGraph` uses the `composable(..., enterTransition = ...)` API and not the deprecated manual transition spec, so back swipes get the system animation.

---

## 4. Android 17 Feature Adoption

### 4.1 — Cross-device Handoff (`CompanionDeviceManager` state transfer)
**Stub only.** `HandoffManager.kt` has the signing/verification flow and an `updateAndroid17Handoff` method that just logs. The real Android 17 API (Beta 3+) for state transfer was being finalized as of the original plan. Action when stable:

- [ ] Replace the placeholder body of `updateAndroid17Handoff` with the real `CompanionDeviceManager.transferState(...)` call once the API ships. Until then, the HMAC-signed broadcast on `>= 34` is the fallback path and works.
- [ ] Add a Settings toggle to enable/disable handoff broadcasting (privacy: handoff exposes what the user is watching to nearby paired devices).
- [ ] Wire `HandoffManager.startBroadcasting` / `updatePosition` / `stopBroadcasting` calls into `VideoPlayerPlaybackManager` lifecycle (per Phase 1 §1 in `2026-03-28-...`).

### 4.2 — Independent Assistant Volume stream
Android 17 splits the Assistant audio stream from media. AI Assistant TTS or audio summaries should use `AudioAttributes.USAGE_ASSISTANT` (or `USAGE_ASSISTANCE_NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` if appropriate), not `USAGE_MEDIA`. Today `AudioService` correctly uses `USAGE_MEDIA` for music. For the AI Assistant:

- [ ] Audit `firebase-ai` and ML Kit `genai-prompt` code paths. If they play any audio (TTS responses), set `AudioAttributes.Builder().setUsage(USAGE_ASSISTANT)`. If they only return text, no action.

### 4.3 — NPU declarations for on-device AI
The plan mentions declaring `FEATURE_NEURAL_PROCESSING_UNIT` for hardware-accelerated ML Kit / Gemini Nano. The actual hardware-feature constant for the NPU is `android.hardware.neuralnetworks` (no app-side declaration needed) or `PackageManager.FEATURE_HARDWARE_KEYSTORE_LIMITED_USE_KEY` — verify what the final SDK 37 docs say before adding a `<uses-feature>` line. Premature addition could break installs on non-NPU devices.

- [ ] **Do not add a `<uses-feature>` for NPU yet.** ML Kit and Firebase AI already auto-route to NPU when available. Just confirm `mlkit-genai-prompt` is on its latest release.

### 4.4 — Background activity launch restrictions (tightened)
Android 17 further tightens BAL. Audit anywhere we start an activity from a non-user-initiated context:

- [ ] `MainActivity.handleHandoffIntent` triggers navigation from an Intent — fine, that's the system delivering an intent the user initiated on another device.
- [ ] `PipActionReceiver` triggers actions from PiP — needs `PendingIntent` with proper flags (already `FLAG_IMMUTABLE`).
- [ ] Verify `DownloadActionReceiver` doesn't launch any activities — it only mutates the worker state.
- [ ] No `Activity.startActivity` from `BroadcastReceiver.onReceive` anywhere — grep confirmed clean.

### 4.5 — Glance widget changes for Android 17
- [ ] `continue_watching_widget_info.xml` and `recently_added_widget_info.xml` are very minimal. Add `android:targetCellWidth`/`targetCellHeight` (Android 12+), `android:previewLayout`, `android:description` (Android 12+), and `android:maxResizeWidth`/`maxResizeHeight` for the new Android 17 widget host sizing rules.

## 5. Tooling / Build System

### 5.1 — AGP 9.2.1 + Gradle 9.5.0
We're on the cutting edge. AGP 9.x reached stable in Q1 2026 and brings the new build pipeline; Gradle 9.5 is stable. **Action**: monitor 9.3 / 9.4 release notes for any required `compose-stability.conf` schema changes — we already have a `compose-stability.conf`, just don't let it drift from the schema.

### 5.2 — Kotlin 2.3.21 + KSP 2.3.8
On stable. K2 compiler is default. Compose Compiler plugin (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`) is correctly used. No action.

### 5.3 — Compose BOM `2026.05.01`
Stable. Carries the latest Material 3 1.4 transitively, but we override with `1.5.0-alpha20` for Expressive components. Per the project's stable-first policy (`docs/plans/UPGRADE_PATH.md`), exit criteria is "Expressive moves to stable."

- [ ] Add a tracking issue: as soon as `androidx.compose.material3:material3` 1.5.0 ships stable, downgrade the four `material3*` alphas in `libs.versions.toml`. Same for `material3Adaptive` (currently `1.3.0-beta02`).

### 5.4 — Lint baselines for new platform warnings
`lint { abortOnError = true; warningsAsErrors = false }` is set. Android 16 SDK introduced ~15 new lint checks (Notification ProgressStyle migration, Predictive Back, Edge-to-edge enforcement, 16 KB native lib check, etc.).

- [ ] Run `./gradlew lintDebug` against the current SDK 37 compile and triage. Capture the baseline in `app/lint-baseline.xml` so CI doesn't regress, but file an issue for each one to actually fix.
- [ ] Specifically check for `EdgeToEdge`, `GestureBackNavigation`, `NotificationPermission`, and `ForegroundServiceType` lint IDs.

### 5.5 — Robolectric on SDK 36 / 37
`robolectric = "4.16.1"` officially supports up to SDK 35 at time of writing. Android 16+ instrumentation tests may need `@Config(sdk = [34])` annotations to avoid Robolectric crashing on unmapped APIs.

- [ ] Add `@Config(sdk = [34])` (or whatever Robolectric's max supported SDK is at upgrade time) to any new tests touching API 36/37 surfaces.
- [ ] When Robolectric 4.17+ ships with SDK 36 shadows, bump and remove the `@Config` overrides.

---

## 6. Dependency Modernization (gates the SDK 37 release)

Pulled from `libs.versions.toml` — only items that block or risk an Android 16/17 final build:

| Dependency | Version | Channel | Blocker for? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `androidx.compose.material3:material3` | `1.5.0-alpha20` | Alpha | Expressive components |
| `material3-adaptive` | `1.3.0-beta02` | Beta | Adaptive layout for ≥600dp mandate (§1.3) |
| `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose` | `2.10.0-alpha05` | Alpha | Predictive back animations (§3.5) |
| `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-*` | `2.11.0-beta02` | Beta | — |
| `androidx.activity:activity-compose` | `1.13.0` | Stable ✓ | — |
| `androidx.datastore:datastore-preferences` | `1.3.0-alpha09` | Alpha | — |
| `androidx.biometric:biometric` | `1.4.0-alpha07` | Alpha | — |
| `androidx.window:window` | `1.6.0-alpha03` | Alpha | WindowSizeClass for adaptive (§1.3) |
| `coil-compose` | `3.5.0-beta01` | Beta | — |
| `glance` | `1.3.0-alpha01` | Alpha | Widget API changes (§4.5) |
| `firebase-bom` | `34.13.0` | Stable ✓ | — |
| `mlkit-genai-prompt` | `1.0.0-beta2` | Beta | Gemini Nano API stability |

**Action**:
- [ ] For each Alpha/Beta line, confirm there's an exit criterion documented in `UPGRADE_PATH.md`. Several are blanket "Hold Alpha (UI Stack)" — make sure that's still the right call once Compose 2026.08 BOM ships.

---

## 7. Testing Plan

- [ ] Spin up emulators:
  - `android-36;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a` (Android 16 baseline)
  - `android-36;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a_16k` (16 KB page size)
  - `android-37;google_apis;arm64-v8a` (Android 17 latest preview)
  - `android-36;android-tv;arm64-v8a` (TV form factor)
- [ ] Smoke-test matrix per emulator:
  - Cold start → server discovery (Android 17: verify `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` flow)
  - Login + biometric (covers KeyStore changes)
  - Browse library + open detail (covers edge-to-edge insets)
  - Start playback → background → PiP → return → orientation change (covers FGS, edge-to-edge, adaptive)
  - Start download → background app → wait > 5 min (covers FGS dataSync quota)
  - Music playback → lock screen → media buttons (covers `mediaPlayback` FGS)
  - Cast to Chromecast (covers MediaSession changes, Cast SDK 22.3.1)
  - Resize window on freeform/foldable (covers §1.3)
  - Predictive back gesture from each main screen (covers §3.5)
- [ ] Add a `connectedAndroidTest` that verifies `WindowInsets.safeDrawing != 0` after `enableEdgeToEdge()` on the home screen.
- [ ] CI: add a job that builds with SDK 37 + `-Pandroid.experimental.testOptions.emulatorSnapshots.maxSnapshotsForTestFailures=1` and runs the smoke set headless.

---

## 8. Risk Ranking (what to fix first)

1. **High — 16 KB page size (§1.1)** — blocks Play Store updates once enforcement deadline hits.
2. **High — Adaptive playback on ≥600dp (§1.3)** — VideoPlayerActivity orientation handling.
3. **High — FGS dataSync 6h cap (§1.4)** — large downloads silently fail on Android 15+ today.
4. **Medium — Lint baseline for new checks (§5.4)** — these are how Play pre-launch report grades the upload.
5. **Medium — Predictive back in player overlay (§3.5)** — UX regression on Android 16 devices.
6. **Medium — Material 3 stable migration (§5.3, §6)** — long-running tech debt, gate-keeps removing alpha exposure.
7. **Low — Handoff real API (§4.1)** — stub is fine until the API stabilizes.
8. **Low — NPU declarations (§4.3)** — risk of adding the wrong feature flag prematurely.

---

## 9. Already Done (do not redo)

For context — these were the standard upgrade items and they're complete in the current tree:

- ✅ `compileSdk = 37` / `targetSdk = 37` / `minSdk = 30`
- ✅ NDK `29.0.14206865` (produces 16 KB-aligned libs by default; just need to verify third-party `.so` files)
- ✅ Java 21 / Kotlin JVM target 21 with `coreLibraryDesugaring`
- ✅ `enableEdgeToEdge()` in `MainActivity.onCreate`
- ✅ `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` in manifest
- ✅ `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` permission declared and runtime-requested on SDK 37
- ✅ `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` flag on all runtime-registered receivers (TIRAMISU+ branch)
- ✅ `PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE` everywhere — no `FLAG_MUTABLE` in non-Cast code
- ✅ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC` declared in `OfflineDownloadWorker.getForegroundInfo`
- ✅ `foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"` on `AudioService` in manifest
- ✅ `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` merged onto `SystemForegroundService` via `tools:node="merge"`
- ✅ `NotificationCompat.ProgressStyle` for Android 16 download notifications (partial — needs polish per §3.1)
- ✅ `VibrationEffect.Composition` Android 16 haptic primitives in `ExpressiveHaptics`
- ✅ `Intent.getParcelableExtra(name, Class)` migration in `AudioService` and `MainActivity`
- ✅ `screenOrientation="user"` on `MainActivity` (adaptive-friendly)
- ✅ `resizeableActivity="true"` on application
- ✅ `usesCleartextTraffic` not used; cleartext gated by `network_security_config.xml` instead
- ✅ Network security config trusts both system and user CAs (for TOFU pinning)
- ✅ POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime permission flow with TIRAMISU+ guards in download buttons
- ✅ Glance widgets declared with `appwidget-provider` (basic config — see §4.5 for polish)
- ✅ `ndk.debugSymbolLevel = "FULL"` for Play Console crash symbolication
- ✅ `useLegacyPackaging = false` for jniLibs (required for 16 KB alignment to take effect)
- ✅ `HandoffManager` skeleton with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (real API binding pending — §4.1)
